NGO Website

This is a simple, mobile-friendly website for an NGO. It has a homepage, an "About Us" section, and a volunteer form. The website is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a bit of JavaScript.

What's Included

-> Homepage: Welcomes visitors with a call-to-action button.
-> About Us: Describes the NGOâ€™s mission and work.
-> Volunteer Form: Lets people sign up to volunteer.
-> Responsive Design: Looks good on phones, tablets, and computers.

Files

-> index.html: The main webpage.
-> styles.css: Custom styles for the website.
-> script.js: Handles form submission (shows an alert when the form is submitted).

Future Ideas

-> Add a backend to save volunteer form data.
-> Include more pages (e.g., Events or Donations).
-> Add images or a logo to make it look better.
